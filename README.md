## Prerequisites

This program is written entirely on **Python**. The libraries used for this project are indicated in the `requirements.txt` file. These include:
- ipykernel
- ipython
- jupyter
- jupyter-client
- jupyter-core
- jupyterlab-pygments
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
- bokeh
- imbalanced-learn 

The data necessary to run the code can be found in [the official 20 Newsgroups site](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs429529-project-2-topic-categorization/data). Make sure to download it and place it in the same folder (or update the locations in the notebooks themselves) before running the notebooks.

## Execution

The code can be ran directly from the notebooks.

## Description

The following is a project about **Naïve Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**. Its objective is to understand how to implement these models from scratch to understand how they work.

### Naïve Bayes


### Logistic Regression
